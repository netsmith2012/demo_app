This demo app from Hartl's course is what I am using to serve up the client IP for KHA
It is running on Heroku at arcane-refuge-9840
I believe this can be changed but it doesn't matter because no one sees it.

To run it locally, change directory to Demo App.
Run this command: rails server
Then start Chrome and enter this URL: http://localhost:3000/
